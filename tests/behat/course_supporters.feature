    Then I should see "Tina Teacher"
    And I should see "Support area"
    And I should see "Mandy Manager"
    And I should see "The whole platform"

  Scenario: An administrator adds and removes a member of the platform team
    # The fields of every row belong to a form outside the table, so this checks they still submit.
    # The page carries more buttons called "Remove ...", e.g. in the message drawer, so look at the table only.
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And I visit "/local/helpdesk/choosesupporters.php"
    And "Remove" "button" should not exist in the ".local_helpdesk.choosesupporters" "css_element"
    When I set the field "userid" to "2"
