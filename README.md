# moodle-local_helpdesk

## How to configure helpdesk?
This plugin allows to manage a moodle based decentralized helpdesk with three support levels. It basically works with Moodle forums. After you installed the plugin, you should navigate to the Website Administration > Plugins > Local plugins > Helpdesk and set up your support site's team (only 2nd and 3rd level).

### Choose your support team (only 2nd and 3rd level supporters)

![Choose support team](/doc/choosesupporters.png)

If you enter a support level, this user will belong to the 3rd level, you can enter any label here (e.g. a special topic for that user like 'technical', 'pedagogy', ...), so that the 2nd level can decide to whom they should forward special issues. Leave the support level empty for 2nd level support users.

### Choose your support forums

Now you need to create at least one course with one general forum and mark it as a supportforum in the course settings of each course (only site administrators can do that). You can also decide here if a forum is marked as site wide supportforum. Only 1 forum can be set as site wide supportforum. If you enable it, all users that open the "help"-modal will be automatically enrolled into that course with the student-role and a group for that user will be created. This ensures private communication in that supportforum, so it is recommended to set the groupmode to "separated groups" in that forum.

### Who is the 1st level support of a course?

The 1st level support of a support forum is **everybody who holds the capability `moodle/course:update` in the course containing that forum** - by default the teacher (editingteacher) role. It is deliberately tied to the capability rather than to a role name, so that you can decide per course, and per role, who answers the requests filed there.

This is what carries the decentralised model: on a platform hosting many schools, every school gets its own support course, and the staff who maintain that course are its 1st level support. Only when they cannot help is an issue escalated to the 2nd level, which is the site wide team you configured above.

Two consequences worth knowing:

* Any role granting `moodle/course:update` in that course counts, including a manager assigned site wide or an integration account. If you find an unexpected person listed as a support contact, check `Course > Participants > Permissions` for `moodle/course:update`, or `/admin/roles/check.php` for that user in the course context.
* By default the people found this way are named to the person filing a request, in the confirmation dialogue and in an automatic post in the ticket. Turn off **Show the support contacts to the person filing a request** in the plugin settings if they should stay unnamed. Supporters are notified about new tickets either way.

You can enable separated groups, visible groups or no group mode - doesn't matter. Users will receive notifications as usual if they subscribe the forum.

You can set one team member of the site's support team (2nd and 3d Level) as a dedicated support user. This means, that all issues forwarded to 2nd level will be automatically assigned to the responsibility of this team member.

Once a forum is activated as supportforum some capabilities in the forum module and course are set to prevent the deletion.

The members of the site's support team (2nd and 3rd level support) will not receive notifications as long as the ticket was not forwarded to the 2nd level. They need not be enrolled to the course itself and will not be able to read all discussions. They will only be granted access to those discussions that have been forwarded by the 1st level support.

## How to post issues?

As we are using normal Moodle forums, users can go to the forum and create new discussions. But possibly not everybody finds that very user friendly, and information can get lost (error messages that appeared, the URL where the problem occurred, ...)

Therefore we integrated a "help"-button (works in boost theme, not tested elsewhere) in the usermenu toolbox (near the conversations-icon).

![The help button](/doc/help-button.png)

If a user presses this button a modal dialog appears and the user can describe the problem directly on the page it occurred. Optionally a screenshot of the page can be attached.

If the user has access to several supportforums he can choose the target, also if the forums use the group feature, the target group can be chosen. If the user has not access to any supportforum the system automatically falls back to an email mode, and the issue is sent to the mailaddress of the supportusers specified in the site administration.

If a user has the capability 'helpdesk:canforward2ndlevel', which is set by default for the teacher role (1st Level Support), it is possible to forward the issue directly to the 2nd level on creation. You can also decide to grant this capability to other roles as well.


## Who is responsible for a ticket?

1. The 1st level support, which means: everybody holding `moodle/course:update` in the support course - by default the teachers. These users can forward an issue to the 2nd level. On the discussion page they will find a button "Forward this issue to 2nd level support". If a dedicated supporter was set for this forum, this user will be named to be responsible for this ticket. Otherwise a random user from the 2nd level support team will be selected. For transparency reasons a post on behalf of the 1st level support user is automatically added to the discussion. Anybody from the 1st level support can also revoke the issue from the 2nd level.

2. All support members of 2nd and 3rd level will find a link "Issues" in the left panel. Under that link they have access to an overview page that shows them all issues, that currently belong to the 2nd or 3rd level support. These issues are grouped to "My issues" (I am responsible), "Subscribed" (I am not responsible, but will receive notifications), "Other issues" (I will not receive any notification, but can access and subscribe).

3. Members of the 2nd and 3rd level support can now assign responsibilities. Once the issue is solved, they can mark it as solved on the discussion page.

![Issue discussion page](/doc/issue-discussion.png)

4. When an issue is closed any subscriptions of the support team will be removed. An automated post on behalf of the closing user makes this transparent to the 1st level and end user. No access to the discussion will be possible anymore, unless the 1st level support forwards the issue again.

This overviewpage allows access to the discussions that represent the issue. All support team members can access only these discussions. On the overview page itself they can subscribe for notifications, if they are not responsible, they can also unsubscribe.
 They can forward the responsibility to someone else on the discussion page, or can take subscribe / unsubscribe from notifications.


1. It splits your support team into the three support levels, and each issue can be forwarded to the next level.
    * 1st level: pedagogic issues or simple technical questions
    * 2nd level:  
2. The first level works on course level. You can have as much support courses for the first level as you like. In our case we have a bunch of schools in our Moodle, and each school has its own support course with the 1st level support from staff of that school.

This block allows users to instantly post problems to a standard forum from wherever they are on the site, including the possibility to attach a screenshot of the current page. It is recommended to use separated groups within this forum.

For that purpose Helpdesk creates a group for each user to ensure a private communication channel to the support team. Users can be automatically enrolled to the course containing the support-forum when posting a problem, if this option is enabled in admin settings.

## Migrating from local_edusupport

Helpdesk is the successor of [local_edusupport](https://github.com/Wunderbyte-GmbH/moodle-local_edusupport) and works the same way. To move an existing site over:

1. Upgrade local_edusupport to version 2.8.0 or later.
2. Install local_helpdesk next to it. Do not configure any support forum in Helpdesk yet: the migration keeps the record ids and only runs while Helpdesk is empty.
3. Open `Site administration > Plugins > Local plugins > Helpdesk` and press **Migrate from eduSupport**. The page first shows how many records will be taken over, nothing is changed before you confirm. On large sites you can use the command line instead:
   `php local/helpdesk/cli/migrate_edusupport.php` (dry run) and `php local/helpdesk/cli/migrate_edusupport.php --run`.
4. Check the issues in Helpdesk, then uninstall local_edusupport.

What is taken over: support forums, issues, supporters, subscriptions, all settings, waiting reminders and mails, and the users' notification preferences. The support team role and the guest ticket user are renamed and reused, so role assignments in the support forums and the authors of forum posts stay as they are.

After the migration local_edusupport no longer knows any support forum and therefore does nothing any more; its issues, supporters and subscriptions remain in its tables as a backup until you uninstall it. Until then its help button is still shown next to the one of Helpdesk. Log entries and notifications that were already sent keep their reference to local_edusupport.
